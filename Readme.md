# Deployment of a Microservice App (Socks Shop) on Kubernetes using Infrastructure as a Code(terraform) and CI/CD Pipeline(Jenkins)

## Project Objective
The aim is to deploy a microservices-based application, specifically the Socks Shop, using a modern approach that emphasizes automation and efficiency. The goal is to use Infrastructure as Code (IaaC) for rapid and reliable deployment on Kubernetes.

This project is about deploying a microservices-based application using automated tools to ensure quick, reliable, and secure deployment on Kubernetes.

## Prerequisite
1. A cloud Account (I am using AWS)
2. Free credits or enough money to pay for the biils in your AWS Account
3. Domain name(I got mine from namecheap)


## Microservice Architecture

A software application built using microservice architecture is made up of discrete, independent services that interact with one another using clearly defined APIs. Every service can be independently built, deployed, and scaled, and each one is concentrated on a single business function. In contrast, all the elements of classic monolithic building are woven together to form a single, harmonious one.

The Microservices Demo project is an educational and illustrative example of a cloud-native microservices application. 
The project demonstrates a complete e-commerce application built using microservices. It showcases how an application can be split into smaller, independent services, each responsible for a specific functionality like product catalog, user management, order processing, and payment.Manages user data, authentication, and authorization.Handles product listings, descriptions, and inventory management.
